[NONE OF THE CONTENT MENTIONED BELOW IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED, IT IS SIMPLY PLANNED CONTENT]
So, you may be asking yourself: "What is the Pyre?" An excellent question! The Pyre is a fire-themed Evil Biome alternative, more specifically a scorched forest, featuring a brand new boss: the Forest Haint!

If you want to see more development relating to the Pyre, find me on Discord. You'll probably find me. I'm everywhere.

[ALL OF THE CONTENT BELOW IS IMPLEMENTED]
Currently, ALL of the items in the mod are UNOBTAINABLE. However, this will change in the next update, when Bloodworms are added(!)
Here is a list of the content currently in the mod:
Pyre Chest -- A Dungeon Chest for the Pyre.
Pyre Key -- Unlocks Pyre Chests. Currently doesn't function properly
Flame Flayer -- Post-Plantera weapon for the Pyre, found in the Pyre Chest, which doesn't generate currently.
Scorched Ash -- An Pyre alternative to Rotten Chunks. Currently, it doesn't do anything
Twisted Branch -- A Pyre alternative to Worm Teeth. Used to craft Ashen Arrows.
Ashen Arrows -- A Pyre alternative to Unholy Arrows, and functions near-identically.
Pyrite(!) -- A Pyre alternative to Cursed Flames, has no use (yet.)
Blood Clot -- A Crimson alternative to Worm Teeth, used to craft Blood Arrows. Unobtainable (for now...)
Blood Arrow -- A Crimson alternative to Unholy Arrows, (now) functions near-identically. Unobtainable (for now...)

Much more content will be added in the future.
